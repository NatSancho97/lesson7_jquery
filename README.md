### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. JavaScript Console Pane: I learned that when you open a file through preview, you can open the javascript console pane. Through this tool you can make in-direct changes to the website and instantly see the changes that you are making and see what they do to the website content.
2. animate() code: I learned and used the animate code for the first time and learned that by using this code you can change background color and add more character to your website content. 
3. hover() code: I learned that the hover code allows you to hover over a tab with your mouse and it instantly reveals everthing that is under that tab.
